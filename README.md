# Prediction of Energy Consumption in Buildings using Neural Networks 
The prediction of energy consumption in buildings is essential when trying to reduce energy usage in the building sector. The objective of this project is to create a model using a Multi-Layer Perceptron/Neural Network that is capable of predicting the energy consumption of a building to identify possible energy efficient  measures in order to reduce the consumption of energy in the building. The model created contains one input layer with three neurons that represent the input features, one hidden layer with 7 neurons that learn the non-linear transformation of features, and one output layer with one neuron that represents the predicted energy consumption. The model produces a Mean Square Error in the training and testing sets of 0.6695 and 0.6843, respectively. The model does not perform an accurate prediction of the energy consumption of the building, and further analysis needs to be conducted.
